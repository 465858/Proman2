<h3>News headlines</h3>

<p>
It seems that the pager control on the project selection was
making it impossible to choose projects from more than
one "screen" at a time. And selections from one page would
override selections on another. I may be able to come up with a fix, but in
the meantime
I've turned off the pager. A consequence is that some of you will see a
very long list of projects.</p>
