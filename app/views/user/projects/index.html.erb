    <p>Dear <%= @user.name.formally %>, here is your current list of projects.</p>
    <p>Until <%= proman %> is open to students
      for project selection, you are free and encouraged to edit, your project
      descriptions and add new ones. However, please be aware of the
      requirements of the School and your research centre's project coordinator. It
      would help if you could refine the disciplines for your projects and indicate if
      your project would be suitable for consideration under the Atkins Carbon Critical
    (C<sup>2</sup>) award or the Swansea University Racecar Engineering (SURE) team.</p>
